"""RSA module

Module for calculating large primes, and RSA encryption, decryption, signing
and verification. Includes generating public and private keys.

WARNING: this implementation does not use random padding, compression of the
cleartext input to prevent repetitions, or other common security improvements.
Use with care.

If you want to have a more secure implementation, use the functions from the
``rsa.pkcs1`` module.
